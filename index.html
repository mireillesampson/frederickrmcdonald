<!--THIS IS THE ARTIST'S BIO-->

<section class="intro">
  <article id="bio">
    <h3>Artist Biography</h3>
    <p>
      Frederick R McDonald is an international, award-winning artist - a
      painter, poet and photographer - and a member of the Fort McKay First
      Nation. Fred was born in Fort McMurray and raised in the bush along
      the Athabasca River, he was brought up in the traditional hunting and
      trapping lifestyle of his parents. Although he has traveled far and
      wide, Fred’s heart is still with his community and he continues to be
      an active member of the Fort McKay band. Fred keeps himself grounded
      through his family; his children and his grandchildren are his
      inspiration for everything he does and they are ultimately his
      greatest creation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The
      <a
        href="https://www.gallery.ca/magazine/books/a-visual-history-of-contemporary-indigenous-art-the-collection-of-the-indigenous-art"
        target="_blank"
        ><strong>Indigenous Art Collection,</strong></a
      >
      housed at the Indigenous Art Centre, is &quot;The most important
      living art collection of contemporary Indigenous art in Canada.&quot;
      Fred’s art has been exhibited at the IAC and his painting Dancing on a
      Table is held in the permanent collection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Glenbow Museum, the Alberta Arts Foundation, the University of
      Calgary, and the Red Deer Museum all hold works by Fred in their collections. Many public art
      institutions and events have exhibited Fred’s paintings, including:
      Wheelwright Museum in Santa Fe (New Mexico, US), the Art Gallery of
      Alberta, Glenbow Museum, Alberta Biennial of Contemporary Art, Nickel
      Arts Museum, Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity and the Edmonton Art
      Gallery.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fred's art is also held in many corporate and private collections and
      he is regularly commissioned to create paintings that bring to life
      the patron's vision.

    <h4><strong>&quot;resonating with the voice of memory&quot;</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Fred McDonald's paintings express many facets of the artist. The
      paintings are intellectual, intuitive, and spiritual...[they are]
      a recollection of life growing up along the Athabasca River near Fort
      McMurray, northern Alberta.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet it is more than that; it is a memory of those who lived long ago...
      As he traces his artistic heredity to those that preceded him, Fred
      McDonald's ancestors live through his paintings. His grandfather's story
      has become his story and history. The paintings, however, are more than
      a history; they are about relations - the relations of his kin with the
      land, water, sky, animals, plants - the environment imbued with the force
      of life&quot;
