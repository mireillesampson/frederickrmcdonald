        <h3>Artist Biography</h3>
        <p>
          Frederick R McDonald is an international, award-winning artist - a painter,
          poet and photographer - and a
          member of the Fort McKay First Nation. Fred was born in Fort McMurray
          and raised in the bush along the Athabasca River, he was brought up
          in the traditional hunting and trapping lifestyle of his parents.
          Although he has traveled far and wide, Fred’s heart is still with his
          community and he continues to be an active member of the Fort McKay
          band. Fred keeps himself grounded through his family; his children
          and his grandchildren are his inspiration for everything he does and
          they are ultimately his greatest creation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://www.gallery.ca/magazine/books/a-visual-history-of-contemporary-indigenous-art-the-collection-of-the-indigenous-art" target="_blank"><strong>Indigenous Art Collection,</strong></a>
          housed at the Indigenous Art Centre,
          is &quot;The most important living art collection of contemporary
          Indigenous art in Canada.&quot; Fred’s art has been exhibited at the IAC
          and his painting Dancing on a Table is held in the permanent
          collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Glenbow Museum, the Alberta Arts Foundation and the University of
          Calgary all hold works by Fred in their collections. Many public art
          institutions and events have exhibited Fred’s paintings, including:
          Wheelwright Museum in Santa Fe (New Mexico, US), the Art Gallery of
          Alberta, Glenbow Museum, Alberta Biennial of Contemporary Art, Nickel
          Arts Museum, Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity and the Edmonton
          Art Gallery.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fred's art is also held in many corporate and private collections and
          he is regularly commissioned to create paintings that bring to life
          the patron's vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          &quot;I know Fred in many different relationships. As an artist he painted
          the 4 foot X 6 foot memorial for Suncor’s environmental success of
          restoring the first oil sands mine to pristine conditions and he
          successfully incorporated both the historical value of the site and
          the future value of our recovery efforts into his images.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know Fred as a business leader from his time as General Manager of
          the Fort McKay Group. We worked together on many difficult tasks and
          his work was always far above expectations. I know Fred as a community
          leader from his time as a board member with the United Way of Fort
          McMurray where he also served as the annual campaign char when UWFMM
          set a new Canadian national record for contributions per person. And
          I know Fred as a friend, where once again, every part of being Fred’s
          friend has exceeded my expectations.&quot;
