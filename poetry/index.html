      <p>
        Published by:<br>
        University of Calgary Press<br>
        Calgary, AB<br>
        2002

      <p>Ancestral Portraits is a retrospective of the art and life of
        Frederick R McDonald, one of Alberta's most exciting First Nations
        contemporary artists. Inside its covers you will find a collection of
        paintings, poetry and personal stories of McDonald's unique perspective.</p>

      <h3> Praise for Ancestral Portraits</h3>
      <p>&quot;Ancestral Portraits is not a book to be simpy read; rather, it should
        be felt and experienced. The poetry, prose and paintings are pregnant with metaphors.
        The colours are bold and intense, reverberating and resonating with the
        voice of memory. It is not a lament but a liberation in which the reader is invited
        to participate.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>- Karim-Aly S. Kansan, Director Northern Planning and Development Studies,
        University of Calgary
      </p>

      <p>&quot;Fred's work captures the essence of the bush economy in thead
         homelands of the Fort McKay people in the northeastern Alberta.
         He paints with a chromatic true vision that cuts to the bone.
         The narrative spine of his work is like the Athabasca River,
         rich in content, fast-flowing, and never ending.&quot;
       </p>
       <p>- Mike Robinson, President and CEO, Glenbow Museum</p>

      <h3><strong>Two Ravens</strong></h3>

      <p>
         2 big ravens<br>
         in the tallest tree<br>
         on the highest branches<br>
         squawking, like a couple of truckers<br>
         can be heard for kilometers
       </p>

       <p>
         for Harriet and Harry, it was<br>
         love-at-first sight, forever together
       </p>

       <p>
         50-ish children
       </p>

       <p>
         now in their twilight years<br>
         their bones ache – it is harder to fly<br>
         maybe, I am just projecting
       </p>

       <p>
         they want to share their truths
       </p>

       <p>
         “Do you speak raven?”<br>
         I asked myself, or did I hear someone or something ask me<br>
         “No, but I wish I could.”
       </p>


       <p>
         I imagine what a raven has to say, often<br>
         I imagine they are kind of a funny bird<br>
         yet, serious when they have to be
       </p>

       <p>
         a biting, social commentary on environmental concerns - perhaps<br>
         followed by proud anecdotes of their children<br>
         then, there’s a new fast food drive-thru opening soon<br>
         excitement, at all the possibilities – that’s what I’m thinking<br>
       </p>

       <p>
         &quot;They are talking to me,&quot; my ancestors told me to listen
       </p>

       <p>
         The tree stands beside a mythological waterway<br>
         with a rusty wrought iron fence growing into its’ side<br>
         holding it from falling, with the erosion, into the river<br>

         the fence is a remnant from when my great-grandfather used to live there<br>
         my grandfather told me the stories - his name was Harry<br>

         I smile as I walk towards them<br>
         I gave them their names, it’s a personal thing<br>
         a kind-of jest – something they would do, I think<br>
       </p>

       <p>
         the ravens love their tall old perch<br>
         they have been using it for 13, or so years<br>
         well, that’s as long I’ve been going back there
       </p>

       <p>
         I see them on those days<br>
         I walk down that hidden bush path towards my secret spot
       </p>

       <p>
         it’s nice to know they are there<br>
         talking to me - we are good friends now
       </p>

       <p>
         I look up and say, &quot;I too, have things to say!&quot;
       </p>

       <p>
         the leaves have begun to change colour<br>
         and once again, I am concerned for my old friends<br>
         there is a bite in the air, but I am warm, wearing<br>
         my nice new camo-jacket with Canada goose down
       </p>

       <p>
         I walk slowly now – my bones ache<br>
         mostly my ankles and my knees
       </p>

       <p>
         I touch the tree<br>
         in the same spot<br>
         I have been touching for years
       </p>

       <p>
         I have a secret agreement with that once-great tree<br>
         this I share, only with my dark feathered friends
       </p>

       <p>
         I look up, they are watching me, their heads crooked<br>
         partly upside down, partly backwards
       </p>

       <p>
         from their perch, they call down to me<br>
         in low guttural croaks and gaggles
       </p>

       <p>
         I am curious to know what they say<br>
         always, sounds like: &quot;welcome back my friend,<br>
         how have u been, where have you been?&quot;
       </p>

       <p>
         I love the view from this spot<br>
         I can see a long way, both up and down the river<br>
         it speaks to me<br>
         just like I imagine it did for my grandfather and his father
       </p>

       <p>
         I stand silent for an hour or so<br>
         listening to the sounds around me<br>
         listening to my friends above me
         looking at the view<br>
         that old view that my great-grandfather knew
       </p>

     <p>
       a young raven flies close<br>
       its wings swoosh<br>
       with a soft whistling sound
     </p>

     <p>
       one of the children, I presume
     </p>

     <p>
       &quot;Hello,&quot; says I, then I croak out a few raven sounds too<br>
       he seems to like that
     </p>

     <p>
       Harriet and Harry croak out a soliloquy of sorts<br>
       and the young one carves back and upwards, landing part way up the tree
     </p>

     <p>
       over the years, I’ve met all of the family, and<br>
       I feel like an adopted uncle – I’m happy and comfortable with that
     </p>

     <p>
       the ravens have been talking to me, quite a lot today<br>
       and through an osmosis of time a metamorphosis has taken place
     </p>

     <p>
       each time I understand more of what they are saying
     </p>

     <p>
       it’s time, I begin to walk back to my truck<br>
       I turn for a quick look at the river<br>
       then up to my friends
     </p>

     <p>
       my heart is happy<br>
       my soul is satisfied<br>
       my mind is clear
     </p>

     <p>
       as I disappear down the trail, walking slowly into the forest<br>
       I hear my 2 old friends squawking

      i left out a few because they are<br>
      too strong and hurtful (like the ones<br>
      with the ‘n’ word), names I have<br>
      been called from my earliest memory<br>
      to now, yes, now –<br>
      you get the idea
    </p>

    <p>
      but if you like, if you are willing hear<br>
      my words as I paddle down the river<br>
      with you beside me in your own<br>
      boat, listen to what I have to say,<br>
      hear my dad speak my<br>
      grandfather’s words, my ancestor’s<br>
      stories, they come from the bush<br>
      and the river
    </p>

    <p>
      listen as we paddle, listen; I will take<br>
      you back to where I came from,<br>
      back to tradition, back to hunting,<br>
      back to fishing, back to my youth,<br>
      back to the place of my ancestors,<br>
      back to my roots and then – back to<br>
      our future
    </p>

    <p>
      but hear this too; i was educated in<br>
      the bush, i finished high school, i’m a<br>
      red-seal ticketed journeyman, i have<br>
      a BFA and an MFA, i worked in<br>
      the oil industry on construction and<br>
      in downtown Calgary in those sky<br>
      scrapers, i traveled around the<br>
      world, i’ve been across North<br>
      America many, many times, i was an<br>
      artist before being a ceo and again<br>
      -<br>
      i am an artist
    </p>

    <p>
      so, say my name, proper or<br>
      improperly, or if you prefer you can<br>
      call me a name, i’ve been called them<br>

    <p>
      choose a title, put me in a category<br>

      sneaky and subtle (i get it – i got it),<br>

    <h3><strong>I've lived the best I Can</strong></h3>

    <p>
      I tried to live life the best that I can<br>
      Which seems amazing, from where it began<br>
      We lived on the other side of those tracks<br>
      Where so many have fallen through the cracks<br>
      Two blocks from main street and just down the hill<br>
      I have fallen too, but through strength of will<br>
      I climbed from that hole, clinging to my roots<br>
      Sometimes, wearing my father’s worn out boots
    </p>

    <p>
      Sitting here it’s hard to know where to start<br>
      For, in each of their ways they played a part<br>
      With friends, I played baseball in the rock-filled fields<br>
      Then next day we’d make wooden swords and shields<br>
      On sunny days, we’d swim in our river<br>
      The stories of them, all kind of differ<br>
      In those vague and magical sorts of ways<br>
      They sneak back in, on those long lazy days
    </p>

    <p>
      Our home was built by our own callused hands<br>
      Next to the tallest pines and poplar stands<br>
      Let’s talk a bit about my neighbours now<br>
      Musings of some, I try to disavow<br>
      But those old days keep pulling me back in<br>
      A few steps from that original sin<br>
      And though I remember them all fondly<br>
      Their faces slip into a darkened sea
    </p>

    <p>
      One friend said he’d protect me to the end<br>
      He’s in jail now for killing two women<br>
      His brother dealt drugs in the big city<br>
      He was shot in a field, such a pity<br>
      A so-called friend kicked my dad in the head<br>
      His car rolled on a dark road, now he’s dead<br>
      His brother boxed, he had a few defeats<br>
      And he too died there on those city streets
    </p>

    <p>
      Ten years ago, one girl who lived next door<br>
      Talked to me of her family’s horror<br>
      Then this boy who came to our side of town<br>
      With his sling-shot, made a girl lift her gown<br>
      Then there was Billy, forget him, never<br>
      He went boating and drowned in our river<br>
      I’d talk about more, you get the picture<br>
      They’re all a different kind of life’s fixture
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, I should speak of my family<br>
      I prayed God would listen and set me free<br>
      My father and his friends, alcoholics<br>
      This made my mom mad; they had no ethics<br>
      She was angry and took it out on us<br>
      Yelling and screaming, we learned how to cuss<br>
      The days of my youth were often dreadful<br>
      So, I tried for years to break the circle
    </p>

    <p>
      I think of them in black and white some times<br>
      Of those who passed, victims, of their own crimes<br>
      I remember them, their pains and glory<br>
      They lived next door and they had their story<br>
      So, every now and then, when I look back<br>
      To our old long-gone home, that weathered shack<br>
      The place that we all built with our young hands<br>
      I think… I’ve lived my life the best I can

    <h3><strong>In Our Kitchen</strong></h3>

    <p>
      John Wayne was eating breakfast in the kitchen<br>
      he was the fourth stranger<br>
      To be sitting there this month<br>
      when I woke up<br>
      So, I was not really that surprised
    </p>

    <p>
      Bacon, eggs, beans and home-made toast<br>
      my mothers’ favourite, and ours too<br>
      the sizzling bacon sound and its’ smell wafting through my bedroom<br>
      made me crawl out of bed<br>

      <p>
        Fresh off the trail, his shirt and vest still dusty<br>
        I heard his horse outside<
      </p>

      <p>
        Mom and dad had a<br>
        ‘make yourself at home policy’<br>
        of course, everyone did
      </p>

      <p>
        Last week there was some fellow<br>
        from somewhere north, Alaska I think
      </p>

      <p>
        Mr. Wayne had made bush coffee just the way my grandfather did<br>
        there was something familiar I liked about that<br>
        I poured myself a nice hot cup<br>
        before sitting at our heavy wooden home-made table<br>
        cut from  100 year old Jack Pine
      </p>

      <p>
        I noticed his big sweat-brimmed hat<br>
        hanging on the hook on the wall<br>
        typical kind cowboy hat
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I noticed his boots, amongst ours<br>
        big, with the pointed toes scuffed past repair<br>
        probably, I thought, from kicking cow patties<br>
        I chuckled to myself
      </p>

      <p>
        In his gruff smoke and whisky voice, he said,<br>
        &quot;howdy Pilgrim,&quot;<br>
        now that’s a bit like a cliché I thought, so I replied:<br>
        &quot;I reckon I’m doing fine pardner, ummm, I mean Mr. Wayne&quot;<br>
        I don’t know what came over me at that moment<br>
        &quot;just call me John&quot;, he said<br>
        When I looked up at him he had a big grin <br>
        he took a sip from his steaming cup
      </p>

      <p>
        Just about that time I heard faint footsteps<br>
        my brothers and sister were finally awake too<br>
        and soon there would be no food left<br>
        I jumped up, loaded my plate<br>
        started eating – shoveling it down<br>
        food was fair game in our house<br>
        even if it was on someone else’s plate
      </p>

      <p>
        Mom walked in the back door, at that moment<br>
        with a basket full of clean clothes<br>
        something looked out of place  -  oh yeah...<br>
        it must have been that she didn’t have that mussed-up housewife look<br>
        her hair was done nicely<br>
        she was wearing her new red flowered summer dress<br>
        the one she had ordered from the Sears catalogue last week<br>
        That made me smile
      </p>

      <p>
        John stood up as she entered the kitchen<br>
        he said, &quot;let me help you with that ma’am&quot;<br>
        of course, mom said that it was okay<br>
        looking at me and at the clothes<br>
        taking them into the front room<br>
        I knew then what my first job of the day was<br>
        I ate slower and filled my cup again<br>
        and poured John another
      </p>

      <p>
        Mom said: &quot;Dad’s got the boat ready,<br>
        John, you can head down anytime you like&quot;<br>
        and to me she said that I was to go along too<br>
        but only after I finished the clothes<br>
        I shoveled down the rest of my food<br>
        Mom knew how much I loved his movies<br>
        she also knew that it would be handy for dad to have me around
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years many folks have made themselves<br>
        at home in our kitchen<br>
        my mom and dad would have it no other way
      </p>

      <p>
        And as a kid there would be many more mornings<br>
        of strangers in the kitchen<br>
        but never anyone, with a dusty hat or big cowboy boots<br>
        or a horse in the back yard

    <h3><strong>Sometimes, the Darkness</strong></h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes, the darkness<br>
      In the middle of the night<br>
      Is darker than it should be<br>
      My heart can’t hold on anymore<br>
      And now a deep cut in my wrist<br>
      Drips with dark, cherry coloured blood<br>
      There’s a delicate trail<br>
      Of blood on the freshly cut lawn<br>
      From my backdoor down to the creek<br>
      I’m looking back at the light in the kitchen<br>
      Wondering if this is a good idea<br>
      But no one has heard my cries<br>
      The voice in my head is strong<br>
      It tells me to keep walking<br>
      As I stumble over exposed roots<br>
      I hear the crickets and frogs talking<br>
      To their own friends and mates<br>
      And to some kindred water nymphs<br>
      Woodland spirits are hidden from view just beyond<br>
      The light of dimly flickering fireflies<br>
      Floating between branches and over the open water<br>
      I am enticed to sit at the end of my short, weathered dock<br>
      I listen for my creature friends<br>
      They have called me out tonight<br>
      But I guess my presence<br>
      Made them nervous<br>
      And all has gone deathly silent<br>
      Yet, a half-light from the half moon<br>
      Wiggles off the ripples of the creek<br>
      The surface of its’ water is calming<br>
      I see a half-clothed mage floating inches above the water<br>
      Waving for me to come to her<br>
      My imagination is over-active again<br>
      Her invitation gives me something to consider<br>
      At least my late-night friends are here with me<br>
      A firefly suddenly zig-zags through this misty vision<br>
      Breaking the hypnotic spell for a split second<br>
      Giving me a chance to ask myself if this is someone<br>
      Or something that I should listen to<br>
      But, the self-pity is overwhelming<br>
      And I loathe myself for having such dark thoughts<br>
      On such a beautiful, full night<br>
      The light of a firefly disappears<br>
      And all that remains, the splash of a fish<br>
      Then the hollow sound of water lapping against rusty metal<br>
      It’s my father’s old green, two-toned ’57 Chevy<br>
      That we pushed into the river over a ¼ century ago<br>
      Giving me the sense of a lifetime flying by<br>
      I’m reminded of 4 mischievous neighbourhood kids<br>
      Running through the bush with bows and arrows<br>
      On similar summer nights, all those years ago<br>
      Happy memories of promises and hope<br>
      That have lived here along this water’s edge<br>
      For far too long, all by themselves<br>
      I tried to reach those stars<br>
      That I thought I could touch<br>
      When I climbed old Walton’s Mountain<br>
      But here I am, sitting on these grey planks<br>
      Stained by the puddle of blood at my side<br>
      Surrounded by crickets and frogs and fireflies<br>
      I look up from that red puddle<br>
      To the faint image of that lonely moon<br>
      Partially hidden by overhanging branches and leaves<br>
      I’ve been sitting there for long enough<br>
      That the crickets and frogs are talking again<br>
      A small sense of happiness slips into my thoughts<br>
      I turn to the right and push myself up from the dock<br>
      I hear my knees creak as I stand<br>
      It sounds eerily like crickets talking<br>
      Something whispers to me at the back of my mind<br>
      And I look over my left shoulder<br>
      And catch a glimpse of that beautiful mage<br>
      Such a beautiful image that time has created<br>
      One of her with an outstretched hand, holding an apple<br>
      But I can’t be so sure; she has disappeared too soon<br>
      I can see the light coming from the kitchen<br>
      It’s not as far away as it looks<br>
      I take a small step forward with my good foot first<br>
      A chill runs up my spine<br>
      As my bare feet touch the dewy grass<br>
      I continue to walk back to the old house<br>
      My pace is careful and calculated<br>
      I feel cool dewdrops running between my toes<br>
      Giving me a strange notion of urgency<br>
      I also feel the softness of the soil<br>
      And the warmth of the earth<br>
      My evening walk has heightened my senses<br>
      This is the 3rd time that I’ve made this walk<br>
      In this depressed state of mind<br>
      It may be the last, that’s hard to say<br>
      The kitchen light hurts my eyes<br>
      As I open the back door to the house<br>
      I take one more look, over my right shoulder, at the half moon

    <h3><strong>She Used to live Next Door</strong></h3>

    <p>
      She used to live next door<br>
      I’m 43’ away<br>
      approximately<br>
      From where we made love<br>
      For the first time<br>
      43 years ago
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the closest<br>
      to her soft young body<br>
      I’ll ever be again<br>
      5’ 3” of pure beauty<br>
      I would guess<br>
      36 – 23 – 36
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, that pretty face<br>
      Perfect smile<br>
      framed by perfect lips<br>
      Conversations with her<br>
      delightful and<br>
      timeless
    </p>

    <p>
      Dark eyes smiling<br>
      looking up at me<br>
      Soft enticing lips<br>
      touching my own<br>
      trembling<br>
      As I recall
    </p>

    <p>
      Firm smooth breasts<br>
      tiny analogous<br>
      pinky brown nipples<br>
      ½” diameter areolas<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Invite my fingers to touch<br>
      my lips to taste<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      I move my left hand<br>
      down to her<br>
      dark hairy patch<br>
      Feeling her<br>
      completely<br>
      pressed against mine
    </p>

    <p>
      Her bedroom has<br>
      one low incandescent light<br>
      Casting soft shadows<br>
      across her face<br>
      across her torso<br>
      Into memory
    </p>

    <p>
      The house is quiet<br>
      only the sound of us<br>
      whispering to each other and<br>
      Her single bed<br>
      creaking angrily<br>
      from the weight of 2
    </p>

    <p>
      I could go on and on<br>
      as long as I live<br>
      to tell this story<br>
      About how I desired her<br>
      how I loved her<br>
      Then, as now
    </p>

    <p>
      who remembers<br>
      their first real love<br>
      I’ll bet everyone<br>
      Or their first real kiss<br>
      Or their first time<br>
      I sure do
    </p>

    <p>
      Those memories<br>
      from her room<br>
      passionately vivid<br>
      Etched<br>
      in my mind...<br>
      I close my eyes!

    <h3><strong>Northern Lights</strong></h3>

    <p>
      There’s a sliver<br>
      of northern lights<br>
      quietly and softly
    </p>

    <p>
      dancing like those almost<br>
      invisible solemnly veils<br>
      worn at funerals by grieving women
    </p>

    <p>
      I am stopped beside the river<br>
      listening to Neil Diamond’s rendition of Leonard Cohen’s<br>
      Hallelujah
    </p>

    <p>
      Here in the darkness<br>
      I am haunted by memories<br>
      of them
    </p>

    <p>
      my mom and dad’s families<br>
      my brother<br>
      and my friends
    </p>

    <p>
      and my friends<br>
      are their almost<br>
      imperceptible stories
    </p>

    <p>
      the song ends<br>
      my window has been open for some fresh air<br>
      and I am cold
    </p>

    <p>
      I hear soft sounds in the sky<br>
      behind that silver veil<br>
      of northern lights...

    <h3><strong>The Last Request</strong></h3>

    <p>
      the saddle was well worn,<br>
      a deep translucent brown on<br>
      a navy-blue blanket, with red trim,<br>
      it had been made for Billy Joe’s Palomino,<br>
      whose colouration was especially beautiful<br>
      on that sunny day with the back drop of heavy clouds<br>
      hanging over the Grand Tetons
    </p>

    <p>
      Billy mounted in one single harmonious movement
    </p>

    <p>
      Bella Coola was especially excited<br>
      because she sensed today, as they did once a year,<br>
      they’d be going into the back country,<br>
      they had been together for 10 ½ years
    </p>

    <p>
      Bella’s name came from her father’s favourite fishing spot
    </p>

    <p>
      She had been Billy’s 16th birthday present<br>
      now – they were best friends,<br>
      a match made in heaven, that day
    </p>

    <p>
      tomorrow was his birthday and as a special treat<br>
      Billy and Bella were making a long weekend journey<br>
      to her father’s most special place in the world
    </p>

    <p>
      their cabin was on a sharp bend on the Snake River,<br>
      a secret place far enough away from the hordes<br>
      where her father would always say,<br>
      &quot;a man could hear himself think,&quot;<br>
      after a few years, he changed it to:<br>
      &quot;where a father and a daughter...&quot;<br>
      the two of them had been going there for 15 years
    </p>

    <p>
      everyone was worried for her - but she was confident;<br>
      she had had the best teacher<br>
      and at her side the Marlin 1894 lever-action<br>
      dad gave her when she started taking long rides alone,<br>
      it was light enough for her to handle,<br>
      with enough power to take down a grizz,<br>
      if the need arose
    </p>

    <p>
      the words of her father always in her mind:<br>
      &quot;put the stock firm against your cheek<br>
      and make sure the butt is firm against your shoulder,&quot;<br>
      it had a good firm kick – it packed a punch,<br>
      the first time she shot it she landed on her butt<br>
      this had made her father laugh,<br>
      his wonderful gruff, affable laugh
    </p>

    <p>
      Billy loved that laugh - she heard it so many times,<br>
      loved the laugh lines around his deep blue eyes,<br>
      loved his deep baritone voice
    </p>

    <p>
      this journey was both special and somber<br>
      she had been given the responsibility of<br>
      taking him back to their special place<br>
      that place in the sun, in the wind, in the peace<br>
      that place where dreams came to life,<br>
      a place for dreams
    </p>

    <p>
      she placed his ashes, with a daughter’s tenderness,<br>
      into her saddle bag, the one with the tie-down still in-tack
    </p>

    <p>
      it would be their last ride together,<br>
      but she knew it would not be the last time<br>
      they would be together
    </p>

    <p>
      she looked down at her mother’s<br>
      green eyes, puffy and red<br>
      a trail of tears carved into her weathered face
    </p>

    <p>
      &quot;I’ll be back in a few days, don’t worry,<br>
      dad wanted me to do this – it was his last request&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
      with that she tightened the straps on her father’s old<br>
      cowboy hat, like the one James Stewart wore in Winchester ‘73,<br>
      stains and scrapes all in the right places
    </p>

    <p>
      turning Bella towards the river valley<br>
      was her signal - they flew with the wind<br>
      like an arrow flying true<br>
      until they were out of sight
    </p>

    <p>
      then easing into a nice steady pace<br>
      they followed the trail her father had shown her<br>
      all those years ago
    </p>

    <p>
      Billy’s tears had turned to determination a few days back,<br>
      in that sterile hospital room,<br>
      her father said to her privately, because he knew she would understand:<br>
      &quot;all is good in the world, I had a good life<br>
      and, it’s okay I leave; it’s my time,&quot;<br>
      the spirit of those few words helped to ease her sorrow
    </p>

    <p>
      the sun was beginning to set when she crested a high rocky rise<br>
      from there she could see their special place, and
    </p>

    <p>
      in a way that only she knew -<br>
      tomorrow was going to be a happy birth day
